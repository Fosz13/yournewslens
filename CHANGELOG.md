# Your News Lens — Release Notes & Updates

## 1. Removed "Pragmatic Implementation" Framing Section
- **User Request**: *"I want to get rid of the entire section that has the pragmatic implementation text."*
- **Changes Applied**:
  - Completely removed `<div class="framing-headline">` across all 3 perspectives (Left, Balanced, Right) in `engine.py`, `app.js`, and `index.html`.
  - The card now flows directly from the Perspective Lens selector (`[ Left | Balanced | Right ]`) into `💬 Key Talking Points & Arguments`, eliminating redundant perspective summary headlines.

## 2. Enlarged Headline Images (Reduced Cropping)
- **User Request**: *"Some of the headline images seem to be cropped a little too much. Can we make that image bigger?"*
- **Changes Applied**:
  - Increased image viewport height by over 50%: from 145px to **220px on mobile**, and from 175px to **280px on desktop**.
  - Adjusted object positioning to `center 20%` to ensure subjects, signs, and faces at the top of photos are not cropped out.
  - Added subtle hover scale micro-interaction and pointer cursor feedback.

## 3. Interactive Click-to-Expand Feed (Faster, Cleaner Browsing)
- **User Request**: *"While we're at it, maybe you should have to click on the image or headline title to get the key faxed [key facts]. That way it's easier to scroll through a bunch of stories and only click the ones that you want"*
- **Changes Applied**:
  - Implemented an accordion-style **Click-to-Expand** experience on every story card.
  - In default collapsed state, cards display only the large photo, tags, title, and a modern prompt (`Tap to view Key Facts & Perspectives ▾`), reducing card height by ~50% for fast scanning.
  - Clicking on the **headline image**, the **headline title**, or the **expand prompt bar** smoothly expands the card to reveal the 4 Core Verified Facts, the 3-Way Lens Switcher, and the Talking Points quotes.
  - Tapping again smoothly collapses the card back.
